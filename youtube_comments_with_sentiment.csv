"Listening to this conversation, I can’t help but feel a deep sense of sadness and also disappointment. It’s almost painful to witness how blatantly Kenyans are being lied to by  Mr. Ichung’wah.<br><br>Having lived in Kenya for almost five years, I’ve seen firsthand how deeply corruption is entrenched in nearly every aspect of daily life. It’s a reality that every Kenyan knows all too well. I always called it the “country of middlemen” because, in truth, the moment someone gains even the slightest bit of power, the temptation to exploit it often overwhelming.<br><br>From police officers fabricating offenses to extort bribes, to the absolute chaos at Nyayo House, where obtaining a visa or permit can take years unless you’re willing to pay the premiums —corruption isn’t just an issue in Kenya, it’s the system itself.<br><br>How can people be expected to trust in institutions when the political establishment lies so brazenly to its own citizens? <br><br>In my opinion trust cannot exist in a system where integrity is an illusion and power is merely a gateway to self-enrichment.",Negative,-0.8157
